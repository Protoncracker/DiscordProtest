A Python tool designed to bypass Discord's text restrictions by converting regular text into special Unicode characters.

## 🎯 Purpose

Discord enforces restrictions on text formatting, making it difficult to express yourself freely. This tool was created as a form of protest against these limitations, allowing users to:
- Transform regular letters into mathematical bold fraktur characters
- Convert spaces into invisible Unicode characters
- Maintain text readability while bypassing restrictions
- Express yourself freely without platform limitations

## 🚀 Features

- Converts lowercase letters to mathematical bold italic
- Converts uppercase letters to mathematical bold fraktur
- Supports accented characters (both lowercase and uppercase)
- Replaces spaces with invisible Unicode characters
- Preserves special characters and numbers
- Type-safe implementation with Python type hints

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Protoncracker/DiscordProtest
cd DiscordProtest/RePlacer
python replacer.py
```

## 💡 Usage

```python
[INPUT] Enter the text to be replaced: Hello World
[OUTPUT] Modified text: 𝖧𝖾𝗅𝗅𝗈᲼𝖶𝗈𝗋𝗅𝖽
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

- Unicode Ranges Used:
  - Mathematical Bold Italic: U+1D51F to U+1D53A
  - Mathematical Bold Fraktur: U+1D504 to U+1D51E
  - Invisible Space: U+1CBC
